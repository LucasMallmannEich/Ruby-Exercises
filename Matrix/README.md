# Matrix Row and Column Extractor

This is a Ruby coding exercise that takes a string representing a matrix of numbers and returns the **rows** and **columns** of that matrix.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Description

Given a string representing a matrix of numbers, return the rows and columns of that matrix.

So given a string with embedded newlines like:

```
9 8 7
5 3 2
6 6 7
```

representing this matrix:

```
    1  2  3
  |---------
1 | 9  8  7
2 | 5  3  2
3 | 6  6  7
```

Your code should be able to spit out:

- A list of the rows, reading each row left-to-right while moving top-to-bottom across the rows,
- A list of the columns, reading each column top-to-bottom while moving from left-to-right.

The rows for our example matrix:
              
9, 8, 7                
5, 3, 2                 
6, 6, 7                 

And its columns:           
            
9, 5, 6               
8, 3, 6               
7, 2, 7
