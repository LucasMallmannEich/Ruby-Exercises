# Acronym Generator

## Instructions

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like **Portable Network Graphics** to its acronym (**PNG**).

### Rules:
- Hyphens (`-`) are treated as word separators (like whitespace).
- All other punctuation should be removed from the input.
- The acronym should be formed using the first letter of each word in uppercase.

### Examples:

| Input                      | Output |
|----------------------------|--------|
| As Soon As Possible       | ASAP   |
| Liquid-crystal display    | LCD    |
| Thank George It's Friday! | TGIF   |
